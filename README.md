# Chicago Art Institute Essentials Personal Project

Welcome to the CAI Essentials Repo

This a public repo that demonstrates and is a sample of my work as a developer and reflects my love for art!

To start, simply run:

`npm install`

Once the installation is complete, run:

`npm run dev`

The project is also currently hosted on GH-Pages @ [CAI ESSENTIALS](https://mochacosine1206.github.io/CAI_ESSENTIALS/)
